<p>“Maybe greener men <i>have</i> hit Alasky&mdash;but I doubt it!”</p>

<p>The speaker, a rheumy-eyed, old veteran of the trails, spoke
thus disparagingly of young Harris Benton. The old-timer’s
perpetual “sun-grin” expanded visibly as he watched Benton’s
parka-clad figure disappear around a bend in the river
trail.</p>

<p>“Wonder how long he’ll last,” the old fellow speculated,
turning to the group on the river bank. “I’ll bet I’ve showed
him a dozen times how to tie his snowshoes to his feet, an’ I’ve
told him little things about pitchin’ his tent and makin’ camp,
till I’m black in the face. It’ll be three-four weeks yet before
mushin’ll be any good, but I’ve got a right good notion to load
up the old Yukon sled an’ take out after that young
chechahco.”</p>

<p>“An’ why?”</p>

<p>The old-timer had paused for that query.
The question certainly gave pith and point to the clever thing
on the tip of his tongue. The remark would have lost its savor
in the telling; the retort, however, was pungent.</p>

<p>“An’ why?” he repeated. “I’ll
tell you for why. I’ve been snow-blind twice, so my eyes ain’t
what they used to be. Nowadays, when I ain’t wearin’ snow
glasses&mdash;an’ blast the dang things, I hate ’em!&mdash;&nbsp;I’ve got to
keep my eyes clamped on the spruce.</p>

<p>“Spruce is dang restful to the eyes.
It’s restful because it’s green, but to keep on lookin’ at it, a
man’s got to twist his head from one side the river to the
other, an’ there’s times when I think I’m li’ble to twist my
head plum off&mdash;like a screech owl. Now, instead of takin’ all
that trouble, I <i>could</i>
start out an’ foller after this young Benton.
Instead of lookin’ at the spruce then, I could keep my eyes
fastened straight ahead on <i>him</i>. He’s greener than
any spruce that ever growed.”</p>

<p>If young Harris Benton could have heard
this sarcastic speech, he would have been rudely made aware of
the withering contempt in which he was held by the general run
of Alaskans with whom he had come in contact. Had he been aware
of the feeling which existed, he would not have been offended in
the least; he would have been amused. He was green but, unlike
many greenhorns, he realized the fact and was anxious to learn.
Moreover, he was willing to accept the hard knocks&mdash;a part of
the curriculum of Alaska’s trail school&mdash;and come up smiling.
For Harris Benton, although he was probably the greenest
chechahco in the North, had not been raised a pet.</p>

<p>At noon, young Benton hauled his sled to
the river bank and, with considerable difficulty, dropped a dead
spruce tree and built a small tea fire. After his noon meal he
unloaded his Yukon sled, inverted it so that the steel-shod
runners shone like twin mirrors in the rays of the sun;
then&mdash;and this is almost past believing&mdash;he proceeded to smear
the steel shoes of the sled runners with lubricating
oil.</p>

<p>The dealer who had sold him the
oil&mdash;either unscrupulous or a practical joker&mdash;had seriously
informed him that “greased sled runners makes mighty easy
slippin’ on the trail.” Harris Benton had innocently bought five
gallons of the lubricant.</p>

<p>Where a musher pulls without dogs, as
young Benton was doing, every pound of excess weight is an
additional check to his progress. And besides the five gallons
of lubricating oil, Harris Benton was hauling other
nonessentials. He had more clothing than he really needed; about
twenty pounds of books and old magazines, and the merchant from
whom he had bought his outfit had sold him far too many cooking
utensils. Benton’s entire outfit weighed almost twelve hundred
pounds, and, since at best he could haul but four hundred pounds
on his Yukon sled, he was relaying. He would haul from three to
four hundred pounds as far up the river trail as he could
possibly travel in a day, cache his load, and return to his camp
with his empty sled.</p>

<p>Early in the month of May he reached the
Kentna country. He had been on the trail four months, and he had
arrived with pick, pan, and shovel, together with ample food to
last him through the mining season. Also&mdash;as every old-timer in
the Kentna country will testify&mdash;he had arrived with the
ambition and energy of a half dozen men in spite of the grueling
work on the trail.</p>

<p>Young Benton spent his first week after
arriving at “the cricks” in building a cache for his supplies.
It was a simple box affair, built of logs, supported high in air
by four posts. He was busily stowing his food and other supplies
in the cache, when a voice at his elbow brought him about with a
start. Looking up from his work, he saw the old-timer who had
offered him many helpful suggestions back at the trading post.
The old man was surveying him, his small stock of provisions,
and his crude cache, with frank curiosity.</p>

<p>“Well, I see you landed here all right,”
he remarked by way of greeting. “I’m camped just above here on
Penny Ante Crick, an’ I ain’t got a thing to do till the snow
goes off, so I thought I’d mush over an’ see how you’re gettin’
along. Staked yourself a claim yet?”</p>

<p>Benton admitted that he had not. “I
didn’t know it was lawful to stake a claim unless you discover
gold,” he added.</p>

<p>“Plenty of ’em stakes first an’ find the
gold afterward&mdash;if there’s any to be found.” The old man’s
rheumy eyes were mildly disapproving. “I wouldn’t worry too much
about makin’ my discovery, if I was you. Most any gravel you
find around here carries <i>some</i> gold. Trouble is
to find it in payin’ quantities. So hurry up an’ stake yourself
a claim or two, before some of these ground hogs comes in on the
first boat this summer an’ grabs it all. Us old-timers takes
just what we can work to good advantage, but most greenhorns’ll
wear out a pair of hobnail shoes just a-racin’ over the country
stakin’. You’re lucky to be here among the first, so hurry up
an’ get busy.”</p>

<p>“Thanks for the tip. I’ll&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It’s none of my business,” the old-timer
suddenly interrupted, “but what in thunder have you brought into
the country in <i>that</i>?”</p>

<p>Benton had placed his five-gallon can of
lubricating oil near the cache, and it was that which had
elicited the question. He was somewhat puzzled.</p>

<p>“Why, that’s my oil,” he said. “How do
you carry yours?”</p>

<p>The ancient sour dough had all he could
do to keep a straight face. This green chechahco had actually
brought kerosene into this wilderness!</p>

<p>“You won’t have no use for a lamp,” he
said gently. “All summer you can read fine print right in your
tent&mdash;any hour of the night, too. I thought ev’ry-body
knowed&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I have no lamp,” young Benton
interrupted impatiently. “I’m green but I’m not quite a fool&mdash;I
hope. That isn’t oil for a lamp; it’s about four gallons of
lubricating oil that I had left over from my winter’s
sledding.”</p>

<p>“I see.” The old man shifted his weight
from one moccasined foot to the other, swallowing his Adam’s
apple twice before he once more found his voice. “I understand
you but I don’t know what you mean,” he said. “How much of this
oil did you use an’ how did you use it?”</p>

<p>“Well, I used about a gallon.” Young
Benton was looking doubtfully at the old man. “I think I see
what you’re driving at now. I allowed that storekeeper to sell
me five gallons when one was all that I needed.”</p>

<p>The old-timer lifted his tufted eyebrows.
“An’ you got through the winter with one gallon,” he said
softly, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Why, I only used it in the morning and
again at noon. Just when I&mdash;but maybe I didn’t use it often
enough. Still, the sled came along pretty well.”</p>

<p>The old-timer barked apologetically in
his mittened hand. At last he understood. It had been so many
years since he had heard of the old joke of greasing sled
runners that he had forgotten. But this boy was so very much in
earnest, it wouldn’t do to hurt his feelings. And besides, it
might lead to serious trouble. This innocent youth had dragged
this worthless stuff over the trail&mdash;pounds and pounds of it.
Murder had been committed for less than a joke like
that!</p>

<p>“The skinflint sold you too much, all
right,” he said, as he reached down and thoughtfully “hefted”
the can. “But you’ve got it here&mdash;I reckon you might as well
forget it. Anyhow, you won’t have any more use for it. You’re
all through sleddin’. An’ now I’d better be gettin’ along. If
you want anything this summer, you’ll find me over on Penny Ante
Crick. Number Five Above Discovery’s the name of my
claim.”</p>


<p class='sb'>Harris Benton was highly elated when he
next saw the old-timer. Not only had he staked a claim on what
he called Benton Gulch but he had actually discovered gold and
he had found it in paying quantities. For a week he had panned
the gravel on Benton Gulch, and he was now displaying his sample
to the old-timer. The old man listened attentively to the boy’s
story, but did not enthuse over the sample.</p>

<p>“You’ve come clean over here to Penny
Ante Crick to show me this, an’ I’m right sorry to have to
disappoint you.” In spite of the old man’s words, young Benton
was grinning cheerfully. “It takes a whole lot to discourage a
young rooster like you,” he resumed, “but I’ll soon show you why
you’ve got to leave that gulch alone. I don’t doubt what you
say. You got the gold here to prove it. But how’re you goin’ to
work the ground? Answer me that.”</p>

<p>Harris Benton still grinned. “I know why
you think I can’t work that ground,” he said. “It’s what you
old-timers call a dry gulch. I know there won’t be drinking
water there this summer. What you overlooked is this. By digging
a ditch less than a quarter mile in length I can get one of the
best sluice heads in this country. Right over that shoulder at
the head of my gulch is where I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know where you mean, all right,”
interrupted the old-timer. “But have you talked with Joe Murtry
yet?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t even seen him. But why should I
talk to him? What has he to do with it?”</p>

<p>“Ev’rything. Joe Murtry owns ev’ry drop
of water in Caribou Crick. He recorded it last spring a year
ago.”</p>

<p>Young Benton was on the point of
interrupting, but the old-timer silenced him. “Now don’t start
to tell me that all you’ve got to do is to go over to Caribou
Crick an’ get Joe Murtry to give you the right to take what
water you want, for Joe ain’t that kind. He ain’t only the
luckiest man in Alasky&mdash;he’s the <i>meanest</i>. If he’s worth
a dime, he’s worth a half million right now, but even so, he
wouldn’t give a man daylight in a dark cellar. You just forget
you ever staked a claim on that little gulch an’ start out
prospectin’ for something that’ll do you some good.”</p>

<p>Young Benton thanked the old man for his
advice. “But,” he added, “I’m not going to start out
prospectin’, when I’ve already discovered gold&mdash;unless I’m
forced to do so. I’m going over to see Murtry at
once.”</p>

<p>“All right; but be ready to run if he
comes at you. He’s the meanest man in Alasky, bar none. Joe
Murtry never done no man a favor, an’ he never will. Mark what I
tell you, son. He’ll chase you off his ground just as soon as
you show up an’ tell him what you want. You’re just wastin’ your
time. But, then, that’s the trouble with all chechahcos; they
won’t listen to an old-timer’s advice.”</p>

<p>Young Benton went at once to Caribou
Creek. In spite of what he had heard of Joe Murtry, he was not
convinced. There was an abundance of water in Caribou Creek, and
surely no man would be mean enough to refuse to allow the use of
the surplus. This line of reasoning gave him great confidence,
but his first glimpse of Murtry caused his heart to
sink.</p>

<p>Murtry was not tall, but he was as broad
as two average-sized men. Yet he was not fat. His arms were
unusually long, and, due to a slight stoop to his powerful
shoulders, his huge hands hung slightly ahead of his knees.
Young Benton looked at him and instantly thought of a gorilla.
With two others, Murtry was setting up a string of sluice
boxes.</p>

<p>Benton watched them for a time; twice,
without waiting to be asked, he gave them a hand. Murtry, who
had barely spoken, paused at last and sized up his caller. What
he saw evidently satisfied him.</p>

<p>“Want a job?” he asked gruffly. “I’m
taking one of these men upriver tomorrow, an’ if you’re lookin’
for work, you can stay here an’ help Sam. Do whatever he tells
you.”</p>

<p>Here was a golden opportunity. Surely if
he favored Murtry, he might expect the big fellow to
reciprocate. “I’m not looking for work for the season,” he said,
“but I’ll be glad to help out for a few days&mdash;if that will do
you any good.”</p>

<p>Murtry grunted. “All I need,” he said.
“I’ve got a foreman an’ fifteen men waitin’ for me upriver. They
mush in from the coast&mdash;their time starts the first of June
whether they’re here or not. Hunderd an’ fifty miles from here.
I’m goin’ up in my boat an’ bring ’em down. You stay an’ help
Sam out till I come back with my men, an’ I’ll pay you the goin’
wages&mdash;ten bucks an’ grub.”</p>

<p>Sam soon shuffled off to cook the evening
meal, and Benton decided to say nothing about his sluice head of
water until after they had eaten. Their pipes going, he thought
it time to broach the subject.</p>

<p>“I didn’t tell you that I was a neighbor
of yours,” he said by way of opening the conversation. “I spent
the winter sledding in my outfit.”</p>

<p>“That so?” Murtry said with a mild
simulation of interest. “Where you camped?”</p>

<p>Benton indicated the direction. “Right
over there,” he said, “I’ve named it Benton Gulch.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t staked that little dry gulch?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes. You see, I believe there’s a
little gold there&mdash;I don’t know how much&mdash;I’ve already done
quite a bit of panning and I hope to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’re a fool!” Murtry interrupted in a
rage. “If you don’t know that I own ev’ry drop of water in
Caribou Crick, it’s time you was learnin’. How do you aim to
work that gulch without water?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I came over to see you
about,” said Benton. “I heard that it was your water and I
thought that you would be glad to spare me a sluice head.”
Benton was speaking calmly, in spite of the other’s belligerent
attitude. “Of course,” he went on, “if the water in Caribou
Crick should run low this summer or fall, I’d quit taking it
out, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’d <i>quit</i> takin’ it out!”
Murtry cried. “You’re never goin’ to
<i>begin</i> takin’ it out! If
you ever start monkeyin’ with Caribou Crick, I’ll drill you so
full of holes you’ll look like&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Murtry’s anger was intensified by his
failure to find the word he was seeking. “Say,” he cried, “you
get clean off this claim! Beat it quick, while you’re all
together!”</p>

<p>Benton was sitting at the rough table; he
rose slowly. “Why certainly&mdash;if it’s your claim&mdash;I’ll leave.” He
was speaking hesitantly but he was not afraid of the glowering
bully who had commanded him to leave. He was simply surprised at
the man’s unreasonable anger. “But even if I have no water, that
gulch belongs to me, and I mean to hold it.”</p>

<p>“Hold it as long as you want to!” Murtry
was shouting after him. “Hold it till you get good an’ tired of
doing assessment work on it! Wait a minute till I tell you
something you’d just as well know now as later!” Benton paused
and Murtry continued. “There ain’t any gold in that gulch, but
even if there was, <i>you’d</i> never get to work it. I’ve got the water an’ I
aim to keep it!”</p>

<p>The old-timer was right. He was right
about everything! He had said that Joe Murtry was the meanest
man in Alaska; he had said that no matter how much gold the tiny
gulch might carry, Murtry would never allow it to be worked.
Benton considered the various things that the old-timer had told
him until he reached his camp in Benton Gulch. Well, he decided,
he would follow the old man’s advice and quit the gulch on the
following day.</p>

<p>Benton had been prospecting the gulch
every day for more than a week. Through force of habit he took
his pick, shovel and gold pan, and went to work in the narrow
cut which he had been running into a shoulder of the hill near
his tent. He was far from an expert with the gold pan, but he
enjoyed the beginner’s thrill, which always came when he “tailed
off” the residue in the pan, and saw the streak of yellow
trickling behind the black sand.</p>

<p>Young Benton extended his cut three feet
into the hill. He was following along the disintegrated slate
bed rock; although he did not realize it, the bedrock was
totally different. Before it had been “slick,” now it was rough
and “rotten.”</p>

<p>He filled his pan with gravel and carried
it to a hole which he had dug in the gulch’s channel. Now the
hole was filled with water from the melting snows; in a week,
perhaps, it would be dry. At least the old-timer had said that
it would, and Benton was now a firm believer in the wisdom of
the old man.</p>

<p>It is a maxim with old-timers that “many
things are mistaken for gold, but gold is never mistaken for
anything else.” A greenhorn is often fooled, for example, by
iron pyrites and “cube” iron, but when he discovers gold, the
real thing, he knows. So it was with Benton. For a week he had
been panning “pinhead stuff” that would “rattle in the pan.”
Now, as he “tailed off” the pan he had taken from the
disintegrated bed rock, he saw that a half-dozen dull-yellow
pieces of gold were in the bottom of the pan. Benton’s old-timer
would have pronounced them slugs.</p>

<p>Benton was excited. He held the slugs in
the palm of his hand, while he attempted to estimate their
value. The smallest of them, he decided, was fully twice as
large as a five-dollar gold piece; the largest was surely worth
more than twenty dollars. The six slugs would total almost a
hundred dollars. Chechahco that he was, Benton still knew that
he had uncovered bonanza dirt.</p>

<p>Young Benton went again to his cut. This
time he worked feverishly for two hours. His pay streak was
rich, extremely so, but there was a heavy overburden to handle.
In other words, above the pay he had discovered on bed rock, lay
ten, twenty, possibly as much as fifty feet of muck and gravel.
Undoubtedly the ground was rich enough that he could take out
hundreds of dollars that summer without water, but if he could
only manage to get that sluicehead from Caribou Creek, he could
with a pressure hose, run that overburden off like so much soup.
He <i>must</i> have that water? But how?</p>

<p>At five o’clock next morning young Benton
was seated on the stump of a spruce where the clear waters of
Caribou Creek gushed into the brown foam-flecked river. He
looked at Murtry’s river boat which was beached near by. It
rested on two fresh-peeled logs, and Benton saw that all
preparations had been recently made to launch the vessel. At six
o’clock, Murtry and one of his men put in an appearance. Benton
had no time to lose; he spoke to Murtry at once.</p>

<p>“Murtry,” he said, without rising from
his stump, “I’ve been thinking the matter over and I wonder if
you would consider <i>selling</i> me a sluice
head of water from Caribou Crick. I’ll pay you what it is
worth.”</p>

<p>Murtry paid him no attention. He and his
man put their shoulders at the stern of the boat and skidded the
vessel into the river. Murtry made a line fast to a convenient
“dead man,” while his man leaped into the stern of the boat and
started the engine. No sooner did he have the engine purring
rhythmically, than he shut it off.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” Murtry, who was
about to cast off and leap aboard, made the line fast again.
“Anything wrong with that engine?”</p>

<p>“No, but&mdash;&mdash;” The man was looking
at Murtry in wide-eyed alarm. He was
afraid to tell what was wrong, and yet he dared not remain
silent. “Mr. Murtry,” he said, speaking swiftly, as if anxious
to break the news as quickly as possible, “there ain’t a single
drop of engine oil. I spoke to Sam about it last night after
we’d loaded the other stuff aboard, an’ he said there was plenty
of oil here. But I just looked an’ there’s nothin’ but gasoline.
There’s more gasoline than we need, but there
ain’t a drop of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You idiot!” Murtry exclaimed. “Chase
right up to camp an’ get some out of the cache an’
hurry!”</p>

<p>Murtry’s man leaped ashore, but stood
hesitantly, shifting his feet as if in a quandary.</p>

<p>“Hurry! I don’t want to wait here all
day!”</p>

<p>“I’ll go look again, but I looked last
evenin’ an’ there wasn’t any there. At least I didn’t see it.
That’s why Sam was so sure there was plenty on the
boat.”</p>

<p>“Of course it’s there. If you don’t find
it in the cache, look in the tool shed.”</p>

<p>At this the
man shuffled off. Young Benton was much pleased at Murtry’s
unexpected delay, but he was somewhat nettled at the manner in
which he had been ignored. He decided to try again, and this
time he would do his utmost to make Murtry answer
him.</p>

<p>“I suppose you didn’t hear me a bit ago,”
he began, “but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I heard you the first time,” Murtry
interrupted with an oath. “Now shut your yap an’ get
out!”</p>

<p>Benton did not move. Seeing this,
Murtry’s great hamlike hands twisted about convulsively; his
lips drew back against his uneven teeth, and with an enraged
snarl he quickly rushed at the youth.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you if you move or not!” he
shouted. “Once I get a hold of you, I’ll&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Murtry suddenly brought up with a sharp
exclamation. Ten feet from Benton, he had stopped with an
expression of bewilderment on his broad face. He was gazing like
a man fascinated into the barrel of an automatic.</p>

<p>“I came ready for you,” said young Benton
coolly. “I’m not on your claim, and I don’t see you or
anybody else throwing me off of government land. And now,
you can at least listen to what I have to say, even if you don’t
care to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ll listen, you young pup,” Murtry
said, “but there’s a day comin’. You’ll wake up some day an’
learn that what I say goes in this neck of the
woods.”</p>

<p>Murtry advanced a step as he said this.
“And you,” said Benton as he menaced Murtry with his weapon,
“may <i>never</i> wake up, if you come another step in this direction. There,
that’s better,” he went on as Murtry retreated a step. “From
what I’ve been told, Murtry, you’re a mighty rich man. It won’t
bother you in the least to sell&mdash;or give me, for
that matter&mdash;some of your water. You’ve got your pile made. Now
be decent and give me a chance to get out of this country with a
little money for all the hardship I’ve gone through. Will you
listen to a sensible proposition?”</p>

<p>“Rave on,” said Murtry sullenly.
“You’ve got me dead to rights. Talk away if it does you any
good, but you’ll get nothin’ out of me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you a third of all the
money I take out,” said Benton, speaking slowly and distinctly.
“If you’ll give me the water to work the ground. Is it a
go?”</p>

<p>Murtry opened his lips as if he intended
to reply; then closed them tightly. A minute passed and he
seemed to reconsider. “You might as well trot along,” he said
contemptuously. “Use your brains. Why <i>would</i> I take a third?
If there’s any money there, I can have it all after you starve
out; an’ if there ain’t anything there, what’s the idee of my
takin’ a third!”</p>

<p>Benton said nothing more. Argument seemed
such a futile thing, so far as Murtry was concerned. Five
minutes passed and Murtry’s man appeared empty handed. His
manner was apologetic.</p>

<p>“It ain’t there,” he said, whining. “An’
there ain’t any on the boat. Sam or some of the other boys
must’ve used it all up last fall before the boat was laid up. I
don’t know what to do unless I mush up there an’ have the boys
come down in a boat or on a raft.”</p>

<p>For almost a minute, Murtry raved like a
maniac. “An’ ev’ry day that my men stay up there, it’s costin’
me a hunderd an’ sixty-five dollars.” He groaned. “Fifteen men
at ten a day an’ my foreman at fifteen a day. That’s what comes
of puttin’ a man like you in charge of my boat. Say, how long do
you think it’d take you to mush up there?”</p>

<p>“A hunderd an’ fifty miles is a good
ways&mdash;goin’ through the brush like I’ll have to do,” the man
said. “I’ll do my best though to make it in ten
days.”</p>

<p>“Sixteen hunderd an’ sixty-five
dollars!” Again Murtry groaned. “An’ maybe a whole lot more&mdash;if
you <i>don’t</i> make it in ten days. Well, what are you standin’
there for? Get a move on!”</p>

<p>“Wait just a minute, Mr. Murtry. I’ve
just thought about somethin’ that may save you a whole lot of
money, an’ save me that long trip upriver on foot. An old-timer
over on Penny Ante Crick has been tellin’ all around that this
young Benton sledded in nearly five gallons of oil last winter.
He was laughin’ about him usin’ it to grease his sled runners,
an’ he’s got upward of four gallons of it left. Now, if you
could buy it off him&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why, of course,” Murtry interrupted
briskly. “I heard about it a month ago. Just forgot it.” He
turned to Benton. “How much do you want for that oil?” he asked
in a pleasant voice.</p>

<p>Young Benton was thinking fast. He, too,
had forgotten all about the oil that he had bought to make
slippin’ easy. He had considered the stuff worthless, but
now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, Mr. Murtry,” he said
thoughtfully, “I had a lot of work sledding that oil in here
last winter. I really hadn’t thought about selling it, but since
you need it, and I don’t, I’ll let you have it.”</p>

<p>“You mean for nothin’?” Murtry asked incredulously.</p>

<p>“Of course not. I mean for a fair price.”</p>

<p>Murtry became suspicious. “What do you
call a fair price?” he countered. “It’s worth nothin’ whatever
to you, an’ I’ll give you&mdash;let’s see, I’ll give you two dollars
a gallon for it an’ allow you a dollar a pound for freightin’
it into the country. Fair enough, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>Benton grinned. “That’s one way of
looking at it,” he said amiably, “but I really can’t think of
letting it go for what you offer. Two dollars a gallon is more
than the oil is worth, but&mdash;the freighting the stuff into this
country. Man, that was the hardest work I ever did in my
life!”</p>

<p>“I get you.” Murtry spoke thickly.
“You’ve got me where the wool’s short an’ you aim to gouge
me. All right&mdash;tell you what I’ll do&mdash;I’ll give you a hundred
dollars cash on the nail. How ’bout it?”</p>

<p>“That <i>would</i> be gouging, as
you call it.” Benton seemed to be considering the matter. “No,”
he said at last, “I can’t take that much money. Four
gallons of oil isn’t worth a hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“Say, what in thunder are you drivin’
at?” Murtry cried angrily. “Are you tryin’ to kid
somebody?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. You’ve made your offer,
and now I’ll make mine.” Benton spoke slowly and distinctly. “As
you said a moment ago, that oil is really worth nothing at all
to me, so I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I’ll just give you the
oil, provided that you’ll give me something that’s worth nothing
whatever to you. In case you don’t know, I mean a sluice head of
water from Caribou Creek. Are you on?”</p>

<p>Murtry was thinking hard. There was not
one chance in a thousand of this confident youngster finding
gold on that little dry gulch. There was water to spare, lots of
it going to waste, but oil&mdash;there was only four gallons of
lubricating oil in the country! With a scowl, Murtry nodded his
head in the affirmative.</p>


<p class='sb'>It was a month later before the old-timer
visited young Benton on his dry gulch. Fully a half dozen men
were bustling about on the claim. Benton himself was closely
watching two men who were holding the nozzle of a pressure hose
trained against a bank of gravel. The old-timer stood aghast
until Benton came over to greet him.</p>

<p>“Well, how in the name of Sam Hill,”
said the old man, “did you ever make a deal with Joe Murtry
to get this water!”</p>

<p>For reply Benton fished a bit of paper
from his pocket, and passed it over. “Read it,” he said with a
grin.</p>

<p>The old-timer slowly spelled out the
brief document.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In consideration of four gallons of
engine oil, I hereby agree to sell, assign, and transfer to
Harris Benton, a full sluice head of water to be taken from the
waters of Caribou Creek, and I agree to allow him or his agents
to go on my claim or claims to dig the necessary ditch to carry
said water.</p>
<p style="font-variant:small-caps; text-align:right;">Joe Murtry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“You’re the first man that ever got the
best of Joe Murtry,” gasped the old-timer. “How in thunder did
you do it?”</p>

<p>Benton explained.</p>

<p>“And now,” he went on, “I’ve got
some good miners working for me, but&mdash;you’re an old-timer&mdash;do
they seem to be working the ground all right?”</p>

<p>“Listen, son,” said the old-timer solemnly. “You don’t need
the advice of an old-timer.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
